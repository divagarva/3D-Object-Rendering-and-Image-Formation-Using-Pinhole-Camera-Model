# 3D-Object-Rendering-and-Image-Formation-Using-Pinhole-Camera-Model
 This MATLAB project simulates 3D object rendering and image formation using a pinhole camera model. It involves creating a 3D cube, projecting it onto a 2D image plane, and visualizing the result. The project enhances the rendering with lighting and shading for realistic visualization of the image formation process.
